# JetsProject
 This project created a fleet of jets with different capabilities. The application created a menu to use jets and access information about them.



# Overview
 The application created the abstract Jet class with model, price, range and speed methods. These methods were extended by BusinessJet, CargoPlane and FighterJet subclasses. PassengerCarrier, CargoCarrier and CombatReady interfaces implemented those subclasses respectively.
 A text file containing specific jet objects matching those interfaces were generated.
 The JetsApplication menu displayed options user selected to manage these fleet of  jets in the Airfield. There were 9 options to choose from: 
 1. List of fleet option printed out the parameters of the specific plane
 2. Fly all jets option printed out the parameters in addition to the total time a jet completed to completely run out of fuel
 3. Allowed user to view the fastest jet
 4. Provided the user to view the jet with the longest range
 5. Allowed the user to load all the cargo jets (there was only 1 CargoCarrier).
 6. Made the user to engage the Fighter Jet into a Dogfight.
 7. Allowed the user to add a jet to the fleet.
 8. Allowed the user to remover a jet from the fleet.
 9. Allowed the user to choose to quit after running the program.
 
  

# Technologies/ Concepts used
 Casting
 If/else if loop
 Scanner
 BufferedReader
 Line split

# Lessons learned
 Abstract classes have to be implemented.
 Casting is critical when multiple variable value types are involved in data.
 UML diagram is very useful in a polymorphism project
